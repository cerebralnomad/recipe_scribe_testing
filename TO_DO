DONE - integrate save edits button on search page

DONE - add config option to start program fullscreen

integrate search page into main program

remember to integrate option to unindent lines starting with a period in directions.
it's in the new version, but not the sandbox version.

integrate the config changes into the new version (python3.10 dependant)

search_path is still hard coded. Make it pull from the config and add **/* for globbing

add insert_bg variables for light and dark modes:
    insert_bg = 'black'  for light mode
    insert_bg = 'white'  for dark mode
then change the insertbackground parameters for all three boxes to teh variable.
currently the cursor is invisible in light mode.
